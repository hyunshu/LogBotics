# Main Developement Branch (dev)
The Development branch (dev) is the main development branch. The dev branchâ€™s idea is to make changes in it and restrict the developers from making any changes in the main branch directly. Changes in the dev branch undergo reviews and, after testing, get merged with the main branch.
